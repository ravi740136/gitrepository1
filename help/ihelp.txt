import task to import xml files
copy todir overwrite **/* excludes
copy todir includes **
fileset includes excludes
tstamp format TODAY DSTAMP TSTAMP new property pattern locale

wires deployment:
-----------------
svn checkout
mvn clean install
cp target/*.tar.gz wires
cd wires
tar -xzvf *.tar.gz
ant clean deploy
tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED FOR ntlm aUTHENTICATION
also configure in web. xml the following things welcome pages, error pages, context parameters, servlets, servlet mappings, filters, listener classes, session config, jsf config
copy tomcat/webapps/ROOT IN BUILD TO TOMCAT BASE DIRECTORY /var/tomcat/wiresqa
in tmcat base bin,conf, webapps and logs folders are important

control room deployment
----------------------------
applicationcontext.xml is present in webapps/root/wen-inf along with web.xml
struts.xml is present in classes folder
first we combine compliance.properties with app.properties and put in build/compliance.properties using concat tag
Automation Strategy:
---------------------
Can be automated or not, which parts need to be automated
is it good candidate for automation, for how long the project will be used and when shoudl it be signed off
Technologies used for automation, which technology will be more suitable
resources required
kind of project has it more UI based or command line based use selenium or jmeter
Do we have required skill set Training required if it is new tool
do we have enough resources available

UNIX Commands:
-----------------
scp /prod/gbo/app/compliance/installation_files/portal/automated_complydev_release.sh vnc2.hyd:/proj/qa-hyd/builds/compliance
scp, scp -r option
sudo 
ssh (remote connection)
root level directories in unix machine var/tomcat etc proj usr/local/java u/qauser
permission u+r u+s u=rw rwx user, group, other
some executables can be provided s instead of x sid and gid

getopts

bashmanual:
http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html

Learnings:
----------
do not edit same property in multiple places
instead in the ant script replace the token in different files by loading a properties file
automation strategy
contribution to dev users and team

Doubts:
----------
what is NTLM domain controller


Control room:
------------------
If we have MNPI (Material Non public Information) related with a project then  we add restrictions on related SPNs so that
insider trading will not happen
CROP interested in the info Eircom restructuring deal which is bankrupt and being sold to Singapore telecomm
different types of restrictions like type1 and type2 are possible
We publish the restrictions to GUAS and PTAP so that PTAP can use this information and approval is not allowed on such trades
When various actions like adding restriction and lifting the restriction happens it should be immediately reflected in log files type1. type2, watch, wall, unrestrict, do not restrict
purely private
GUAS has wash kill file where the restrictions are published GUAS will check for these restrictions and will not ensure that trades will not happen on 
those SPNs/companies
Similary PTAP will have files where the restritions are uploaded while approving a PTAP Trade compliance will check for the restricted SPNs
	Verified that the user can publish watchlist restrictions Restrict Type 1 with Scope = All children. It updates the log files correctly.
	Verified that the user can publish watchlist restrictions Restrict Type 2 with Scope = All children. It updates the log files correctly.
	There is utility service to publish restrictions to GUAS and PTAP (http://desflow/Q/ComplyDev/2724)

	bo/complydev/trunk/reports/bin/Watchlist/publish_restrictions_to_guas.pl 
	bo/complydev/trunk/reports/bin/Watchlist/publish_restrictions_to_ptap.pl
We generate the trade reports for watch list, gray list and restricted list we can analyse the report to check if invalid trades are happened
trades should not be made on type 1 restricted list, One side trades are possible on type2 list. Trades are alowed on watch list and gray list
we need to ensure that firm level  the restriction is applied so all the trades wil appear in trade report. Personal trades will not be reflected 
in the report

sql commands:
----------------
command to add role member
EXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_datareader', N'deshaw\brahmaj'

SElenium:
------------
libs and source are present in selenium-java download
latest version is 2.28
Firefoxprofile.setEnableNativeEvents(false) is useful and will avoid some unexpected issues

To get status codes returned by URLs

prefs.js file and about:config will give list of preferences

Complete list of preferences can be seen from following URL
http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config_entries
enable.javascript, home, no tab display etc can be set
Taking screenshots is useful, default saved in png in temp directory.
can be copied to any other format and location using fileutils

Maven:
-----------
Coomand to execute specific module
mvn -pl WiresAuto -am clean test
Debugging using eclipse:
-------------------------
Surefire Approach.
Create a new Java Project and call it “Maven Debug”. This Project will never have any source code in it, it is just a shell for attaching the debugger.
Create a debug configuration: Run -> Debug Configurations and then right click on Remote Java Application and select New launch configuration. Call it “Maven Surefire”.
Â On the Connect tab click the Browse button and select the “Maven Debug” project.
Set connection properties to localhost and port 5005. This is the port on which Surefire waits for the debugger.
The connection type is Standard (Socket Attach)
On the Source tab add all projects that have any Maven source that you want to debug.
Now let’s do the actual debugging.
Select break points in the code you’re are going to run. Note, you cn select only code in your test classes. It won’t work on classes outside the test phase.
In your command line, append the following switch to your maven command: -Dmaven.surefire.debug. For example, to debug the tests run by the maven lifecycle install do mvn install -Dmaven.surefire.debug
Wait for maven to pause its execution and display the message: Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005
Attach the debugger to the running maven by selecting the “Maven Surefire” debug configuration created above. Your debugger should stop at your breakpoint.
Generic Approach.
Follow the instructions, presented here. The only instructions that worked for me. They are very similar to the Surefire Approach.
Note: use Maven 2.0.8 or higher. The, you don’t need to write your own maven debug script. It’ll be sufficient to use the shipped mvnDebug script.

Debug commands for eclipse:
----------------------------
we can even see the variables values by pointing to variable in the code
Table 1. Debugging Key bindings

Command	Description
F5	Goes to the next step in your program. If the next step is a method / function this command will jump into the associated code.
F6	F6 will step over the call, i.e. it will call a method / function without entering the associated code.
F7	F7 will go to the caller of the method/ function. This will leave the current code and go to the calling code.
F8	Use F8 to go to the next breakpoint. If no further breakpoint is encountered the program will run normally.

XPATH:
----------
used advanced xpath expression to find following radio button of a specific wire
td preceding sibling elment with class  "GAwaitingSignApproval" , of td element whose child link is 381246
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//td[child::a[. = '381246']]/preceding-sibling::td[@class =' GAwaitingSignApproval GMPx1xx GMCellPanel GMEmpty GMCellBorderFF3 HideCol0Panel']")).click();

Advanced user actions:
------------------------
4 Solved scroll bar issue as follows
			try{
			driver.findElement(By.xpath("//td[child::a[. = '"+wireId+"']]/preceding-sibling::td[@class[contains(.,'GAwaitingSignApproval')]]")).click();
			}
			catch (Exception ElementNotVisibleException){
				Action a = new Actions(driver).clickAndHold(driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@onscroll='Grids[0].Scrolled();']"))).moveByOffset(0, 250).release().build();
				a.perform();
			}
			
			Solved alert issue:
			org.openqa.selenium.UnhandledAlertException: Modal dialog present
			----------
		3	Advantage is we need not depend on other elements which are not directly related with this element, we can handle dynamic xpath cases where element does not have id or name
			it can happen in third part tools like treegrid
			We can use index of element, attribute, text, conatains text attribute value for identifying the element
			enclose the string values in single quotes
			To include double quotes in xpath escape it using back slash
			ignore br tags the text belongs to the parent tag
			we can follow the tag with multiple pais of square brackets to specify multiple attributes of the element
			we can specify the attributes of child and other axes also to identify the actual element by mentions square brackets enclosed in square brackets
			we can dynamically genearte teh XPath as shown above by including thins like wire id in XPATH

			Using database:
			---------------
		1	changing the logger from backend so that we can approve the wire
			get information like wireid using request id from database
			Challenge:
		2	verification of values of form after submitting the form
			there can be different types of fields like select, checkbox, radio button, text box, multi select
Selenium Help:
-----------------
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/SeleniumHelp

Database use:
--------------
While approving wire, chnaging the logger so that user can approve the request


Java doubts:
------------
1. If exception happens in a called method, can that be caught in caller method (got the answer)

Wires
------
Account details:
Account id, Entity , broker, bank, protocol, bank account name, account no, currency, account classifier, custodian account, CITCO Control
Source portfolio, strategy, beneficiary bank and intermediary bank, individual and institutional accounts

Intermediant bank is required fro non us accounts

protocol will be ABA or swift

for example tax payment to state of washington amount will be transferred from management company to Thiord party account washington state government
from HSBC bank to Bank of America NY No startegy and portfolio are associaed with the se accounts  as they are non-trade accounts
It belongs to category tax deshaw account is intitutional and government account is individual
this transfer will not be uploaded to coda DNU status will be set

Instructions are setnt to source bank as swift or fax or efax

Operations purpose and trading purpose, tax purpose

clone wire, multiple wires request, preview coda, bulk update, configure grid, export to excel, approve, release, tracking-only wires
Advanced search treegrid sorting, grouping functionality, export to excel maintain refernce data to manage metadata

ThinJDB:
------------
Goal is to improve the code coverage of the changes made in current build
Prepare Breakpoints list bp.txt using diff generated between builds
Start debugger which uses java debugger interface
Start the application in debug mode
set break points
Generate report of coverage
Again write tests to cover the lines which are not covered
Again repeat the debug process
JPDA Port for every application to start in debug mode

Kind of verifications:
-----------------------
Lokk fo rthe text in wires history Wire Status changed from " Pending Release " to " Released " 
Transmission Type changed from "  " to " Fax "
